# About

This project is a part of Full Stack Developer Nanodegree from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004).

It is a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to my projects.

The design in HTML and CSS is replicated from a design mockup as a [PDF-file](https://storage.googleapis.com/supplemental_media/udacityu/2655898586/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf) given by Udacity.
